In this project a prototyp named ComeTogether will be created. He runs on smartphones with the android operating system. ComeTogether is a mixture of an eventcalendar and a platonic touch. ComeTogether is an app to establish social contacts. It is not a flirt app or a dating app, but an app to meet immediately a whole group of new people simultaneously and have fun with them. The core of the application consists of an offer function and a search function. With offer you can offer events with a participating group of people. With search you can find a group of people which participate in the event you have searched. Both, users who offer and users who search signalise with an offer or a search, that they want actively meet new people.
