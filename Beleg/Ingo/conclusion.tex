\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{Conclusion}
For this project a lot of time was needed only to create a prototype of ComeTogether. It was time consuming to find the proper way to implement the communication between the android client and the backend. And there was a lack of knowledge to handle the errors while creating this project on google app engine. In a future work new features like a picture upload or a radius search could be implemented and the backend could be moved to a  Platform as a Service provider.
