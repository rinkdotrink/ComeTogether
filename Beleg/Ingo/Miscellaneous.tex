To test the backend classes EasyMock 3.0 is used. EasyMock is a test framework for the dynamic generation of mock objects for interfaces and classes. Mock objects are used to unit testing java classes.

The backend uses the architecture pattern dependency injection to minimize dependencies between objects. 
With dependency injection, the object does not creates its dependent objects anymore.
These dependencies are created by a framework. The code of the object become independent of its environment. In this way the object is easy to test because dependencies are available centralized.
The backend uses the dependency injection framework called google guice.

For marshalling objects and unmarshalling JSON strings Jackson is used. Jackson is a multi-purpose Java library for processing JSON.

The communication between client and backend is done by apache http. The client uses post-requests.
