	The principal component analysis was used to compress the descriptor
	groups into principal components. The most significant descriptors
	of each set were selected and used as input for the ANN. The genetic
	algorithm (GA) was used for the selection of the best set of extracted

	a back-propagation of error algorithm was used to process the nonlinear

	vision on parallel evolutionary optimizations. The second part is
	about hardware implementations of genetic algorithms, a valuable
	topic which is hard to find in the present literature. The third
	part treats the problem of distributed evolutionary computation and
	presents three interesting applications wherein parallel EC new ideas
	are featured. Finally, the last part deals with the up-to-date field
	of parallel particle swarm optimization to illustrate the intrinsic
	similarities and potential extensions to techniques in this domain.
	The book offers a wide spectrum of sample works developed in leading
	research throughout the world about parallel implementations of efficient
	techniques at the heart of computational intelligence. It will be
	useful both for beginners and experienced researchers in the field
	of computational intelligence.}

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) find numerous applications, and practical
	knowledge on EAs is immense. In practice, sophisticated population-based
	EAs employing selection, mutation and crossover are applied. In contrast,
	theoretical analysis of EAs often concentrates on very simple algorithms
	such as the (1+1) EA, where the population size equals 1. In this
	paper, the question is addressed whether the use of a population
	by itself can be advantageous. A population-based EA that neither
	makes use of crossover nor any diversity-maintaining operator is
	investigated on an example function. It is shown that an increase
	of the population size by a constant factor decreases the expected
	runtime from exponential to polynomial. Thereby, the best gap known
	so far is improved from superpolynomial vs. polynomial to exponential
	vs. polynomial. Moreover, it is proved that the exponential and polynomial
	runtime bounds occur with a probability exponentially close to one
	if the population size is a constant (resp., a small polynomial).
	Finally, a second example function, where only a small population
	leads to a polynomial runtime, and a hierarchy result on the appropriate
	population size are presented. The analyses show formally how the
	population size can lead to different attractors in the search space.},
